Reasons hybrid vehicle are used:
ICEâ€™s havelimited efficiency.
In an hybrid vehicle is increased the eficciency using alternative propulsion systems.

The power is used for 2 main loads: road load (torque of the wheels) and acessory.
most of the power is used for road porpuse.

**Road load**
Is composed by three forces
- A: aerodynamic, depends by:
    - C aerodynamic drag coefficient (around 0.4)
    - A vehicle front area (around 1.5m^2)
    - P air density
    - V effective air/vehicle relative velocity
- G: grade resistant
- R: rolling depends on:
    - tire pressure
    - tire temperature
    - type of surface
